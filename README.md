# Dynamic-Memory-File-System
A C-based simulation of a UNIX-like hierarchical file system, built entirely using dynamic memory allocation and data structures such as linked lists, trees, and recursion.  This project demonstrates core DSA concepts — pointers, dynamic structures, recursion, tree traversal, and memory management .
